          A little note as to why useEffect's do not properly update the state if you don't update state based on the current state.
          For example:
          <pre>
            <code>
function Component() {
  let [lst, setLst] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(n =&gt; setList([...lst, n]));
  }, []);
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      {lst.map(item =&gt; 
        &lt;div key={"item: " + item}&gt;
          {item}
        &lt;/div&gt;
      )}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you run this code, the only item that will be in the list is 5.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason that the list has only 5, is because of closures. 
          You are also probably thinking (or at least I was) that even if it was a closure, 
          if we are calling setState (<i>setLst</i>), 
          shouldn't the <i>lst</i> variable be updated since the <i>lst</i> was in a higher scope and we are updating and accessing that same variable?
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason is because everytime (not necessarily everytime because React might batch together setState calls for optimization reasons) you call setState (<i>setLst</i>), the component function, <i>Component</i>, gets rerendered and your component is recalled (something like <i>Component() or React.createElement(Component)</i>. I don't know the specifics).
          Once our component is rerendered, a new closure is created and so the useEffect function that you passed in previously, is referring to an old closure that holds an outdated version of <i>lst</i>.
          Which is why <i>lst</i> contains just 5 because in the old closure, <i>lst</i> is only equal to [] (an empty list).
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to fix this problem, we need to change <pre><code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(n =&gt; setLst([...lst, n]))</code></pre>
          to <pre><code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(n =&gt; setLst(currentLst =&gt; [...currentLst, n]))</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          So instead of referring to an old closures version of <i>lst</i>,
          we use the current state of <i>lst</i> (currentLst), to update our state
          which leads to a correct list that includes the numbers 1-5.
